 # **_NOTETAKER_**
  
## **_Description_**
This is just another browser based notetaker

## **_Technologies Used_**  
* JavaScript
* NodeJS 
* Express

## **_Installation_**
Note: users are expected to have some knowledge of JavaScript

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't done so yet.
* You should also have pulled this repository at this point (we'll get to Node in second)
* On your project directory, you will initialize npm by typing ```npm init```
* After that command runs a series of processes, you're ready to use npm.
* Type ```npm install express``` on the root of the repo you've just pulled. This will fetch express making it possible for Node to use the functionality provided by the express package. 
* The application should look something like this:
* Let's now run ```npm run``` on your terminal (make sure you're on the same directory as the 'server.js' file when you run the command)
